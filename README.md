# C++ Learning Journey

## Day One: Getting Started

Welcome to the first day of our C++ learning adventure! Here's what we've covered:

### Setup
- Installed a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) and a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
- Configured the development environment.
- Downloaded MinGW from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).

### MinGW Installation
1. First, download MinGW from the link above.
2. Open the downloaded source file.
3. Install MinGW.
4. Open MinGW Installation Manager.
5. Select all the necessary files.
6. Click on Installation.
7. Apply Changes.
8. Set the path of MinGW in your system’s environment variables.
9. Enjoy your new setup!

### Visual Studio Code Installation
1. Download Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Open the installer.
3. Open the `.exe` file and install with the default settings.
4. After installation, right-click on a folder and select “Open with Code” to start using Visual Studio Code.

### First Program: Hello, World!
- Wrote our first C++ program to print "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Concepts Covered
- **Variables:** Introduction to variables and data types (int, float, char, string).
- **Data Types:** Understanding different data types and their uses.
- **Loops:** Basics of loops (for, while).
- **Conditional Statements:** Introduction to if-else statements.

### Code Snippet
Here’s our first program in C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
